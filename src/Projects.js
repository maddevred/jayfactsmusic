    <p>Team Project. Full-stack application to find tattoo inspiration as well as local tattoo shops, both of which can be saved and added to a user profile for future use. 
        Additionally, users can see tattoos they are interested in on a hypothetical body part of their choosing. 
        Built using mongoDB, React, Axios, Cloudinary and Bootstrap Styling, as well as API routing.
        One of the challenges we faced as a team was communicating the way our instructors told us to.
        We did not enjoy being on camera when coding because for some of us it throws our focus, so 
        we solved this issue by utilizing Slack to our fullest advantage and doing group phone calls instead. 
        This greatly improved our communication and we publicly deployed and presented our application with minimul bugs.    
        Deployed and hosted on Heroku. </p>

    <p>Website application on Tetrahydrocannabinol strains and information. 
        Built using Express, Node.js, mongoDB, JS, and HTML. 
        One of the most difficult challenges I faced was implementing my API.
        Due to probable errors in my API routing, this issue still has not been resolved.
        Looking for an awesome dev to collab with on the finishing of this project!
        Deployed and hosted on Heroku.</p>
